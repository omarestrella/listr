A native iOS app for listing the things in your life

## Why

I wanted to learn some Objective-C and iOS, so I decided to build an app to let me keep track of a few
lists (specifically groceries) in a very simple and clean user interface.

## Features

  * Create lists
  * Add items to lists
  
If you are looking for a more robust feature set and social tie-ins, [Avelist (http://avelist.com/)](http://avelist.com) 
is a great place to create, share, and keep track of lists.
